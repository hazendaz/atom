Atom Distro
-----------

This project takes atom distribution from mirror downloads for distribution using maven central.

For more information on atom, please see [atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/)

# Motivation #

Atom does not currently provide a maven central distribution. This project aims to solve that by providing users an alternative location to pull rather than the various apache mirror sites.

# Retired #

This never became anything more than setup, atom has since discontinued.  Simply put into github for example purposes but won't ever be used to release anything.
